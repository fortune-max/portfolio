                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Fortune.</p>
                <p>I enjoy writing beautiful code, and sometimes... building beautiful interfaces.</p>
                <p>Iâ€™m a lot of things (including a Linux command :p) but at present, I am currently improving my frontend and design skills.</p>
                <p>I enjoy reading (mostly sci-fi) in my spare time, playing vidya gaems, discovering memes, biking, and going on long walks.</p>
